node js core modules:-
====================================
Node.js has a set of built-in modules that provide certain functionality. 
These are the core modules. 
Some of the commonly used core modules are:

fs (File System): provides an API for interacting with the file system.
http: provides an HTTP server and client for making HTTP requests.
path: provides utility functions for working with file and directory paths.
stream: provides a base API for implementing stream-based transforms.
util: provides utility functions for formatting and parsing.


To use a core module, you can use the require() function and pass the module name as a string. 
For example:

const fs = require('fs');
