To create a basic HTTP server in a Node.js program, you can use the following code:

const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  response.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () => {
  console.log('Server listening on http://localhost:3000');
});



This code uses the http core module to create an HTTP server that listens for incoming requests and sends a response back to the client.

The server listens for requests on port 3000 and responds with a plain text message "Hello World".

The createServer method takes a callback function that is called for each incoming request. The callback function receives two arguments: a request object that contains information about the incoming request, and a response object that you can use to send a response back to the client.

The writeHead method is used to set the HTTP status code and the Content-Type header of the response. The end method is used to send the response body and end the response.

The listen method is used to start the server and listen for incoming requests on a specific port and host. In this example, the server listens on port 3000 on the localhost.
