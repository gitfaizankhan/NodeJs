Q-1. What is Node Js
Ans:- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code without a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.
